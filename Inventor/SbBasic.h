/* COMPILER BUG WORKAROUND:

   We've had reports that Sun CC v4.0 is (likely) buggy, and doesn't
   allow a statement like

     SoType SoNode::classTypeId = SoType::badType();

   As a hack we can however get around this by instead writing it as

     SoType SoNode::classTypeId;

   ..as the SoType variable will then be initialized to bitpattern
   0x0000, which equals SoType::badType(). We can *however* not do
   this for the Intel C/C++ compiler, as that does *not* init to the
   0x0000 bitpattern (which may be a separate bug -- I haven't read
   the C++ spec closely enough to decide whether that relied on
   unspecified behavior or not).

   The latest version of the Intel compiler has been tested to still
   have this problem, so I've decided to re-install the old code, but
   in this form:

     SoType SoNode::classTypeId STATIC_SOTYPE_INIT;

   ..so it is easy to revert if somebody complains that the code
   reversal breaks their old Sun CC 4.0 compiler -- see the #define of
   STATIC_SOTYPE_INIT below.

   If that happens, we should work with the reporter, having access to
   the buggy compiler, to make a configure check which sets the
   SUN_CC_4_0_SOTYPE_INIT_BUG #define in include/Inventor/C/basic.h.in.

   (Note that the Sun CC compiler has moved on, and a later version
   we've tested, 5.4, does not have the bug.)
